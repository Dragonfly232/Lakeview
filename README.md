# Lakeview

A website for the Lakeview Orphanage and Nursery, located in a small village near Masaka, in Uganda. The orphanage is run by a Christian couple, 
that has a strong belief in Gods mercy and a calling to help children in need of care.
This website is ment to provide an insight in the daily lives of this community,
aswell as to give interested parties an option to make secure donations.
There is a great need of funds for school attire, books and pencils, along with other daily necessities.
The site will be a welcome opportunity for the orphanage and to present itself officially!

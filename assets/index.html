            <p>In a small village near Masaka in Uganda, a Cristian couple has taken it upon themselves to care for children in need. 
               There is a church and a school, both in need of renovation, so teaching takes place outside, at the moment.
               More than 500 children, between 4 and 14 years of age, attend school here in 2022.
               Their strong faith keeps everyday joyful, despite difficulties. Celebrating holiday and providing food and necessities is a daily challenge,
               but improving the childrens future possibilities are a driving force; "We can see that education is important for their future", 
               says Mr. and Mrs. Pastor, so this is our main focus. 
               "If we view life as a gift and trust that God will provide, many things are possible; we must continue, because the small ones depend on it!"
